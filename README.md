# Why I Took the Course and What I Learned

## üìñ Why I Took the Course

I enrolled in the **Statistics Bootcamp with Python: Zero to Mastery** course to:
- Strengthen my foundation in **statistics**, essential for my goals in **data engineering**, **data science**, and **machine learning**.
- Gain practical experience in applying statistical concepts using Python.
- Build confidence in performing tasks like **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **hypothesis testing**, and **regression modeling**.
- Enhance my portfolio with real-world statistical analysis and Python-driven projects.

This course offered a blend of theoretical knowledge and hands-on practice, making it a perfect fit for my learning objectives.

## üìö What I Learned

### **1. Core Statistical Concepts**
- Calculated measures of central tendency: `mean`, `median`, and `mode`.
- Understood measures of dispersion: `variance` and `standard deviation`.
- Recognized different data types and scales of measurement for appropriate analysis.

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualized datasets using Python libraries like `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`.
- Summarized data with descriptive statistics to uncover trends and insights.

### **3. Probability and Distributions**
- Mastered fundamental probability concepts and rules (e.g., `Bayes' Theorem`).
- Explored statistical distributions:
  - Normal distribution
  - Binomial distribution
  - Poisson distribution
- Understood and applied the `Central Limit Theorem`.

### **4. Hypothesis Testing**
- Formulated null and alternative hypotheses.
- Conducted statistical tests:
  - `t-tests`
  - `z-tests`
  - `chi-square tests`
- Interpreted `p-values` and `confidence intervals` for informed decision-making.

### **5. Regression Analysis**
- Built and interpreted linear regression models using Python.
- Differentiated between `correlation` and `causation`.
- Applied regression techniques to predict outcomes and analyze relationships.

### **6. Python for Statistics**
- Leveraged Python libraries for statistical analysis:
  - `NumPy`
  - `Pandas`
  - `SciPy`
  - `Statsmodels`
- Created data visualizations using `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` to present insights effectively.
